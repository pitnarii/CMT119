                Computational thinking allows me to break down complex problems into minor problems. It’s the way to
                understand what problem is happening in the project. Therefore, it helps to identify the detail in the
                problem rather than solving the large one at once. The large problem has been extracted to several
                details
                can have the same issue that can be recognized as the same pattern and solved with the same method. The
                next
                technique is an abstraction with a huge amount of information; it is significant to let go of some
                information that is not relevant and preserve information that is crucial to solving the problem.</p>
            <p class="second_comp">After everything has been examined, identified the sharing information, filtered out
                unnecessary information,
                the
                next step is to design the resolution into instruction. In my opinion, Computational thinking is an
                important skill set for everyone, especially students in the STEM field, because it makes the complexity
                of
                problems become more approachable. A lot of people, when they encounter a complex problem, can be
                overwhelming sometimes. Computational thinking can enhance the way people think to be more structural,
                which will be useful for a role that needs problem-solving skills. My plan for the future career is to
                become a game developer.
