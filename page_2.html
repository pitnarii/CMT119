            <p class="first_bio">
                He is a British Scientist who invented the world wide web. He was born on June 8, 1955. He graduated
                from the Queen’s College at the University of Oxford 1st class degree in physics in 1976. After He
                graduated
                from the university, he spent two years working at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. He later joined D.G
                Nash
                Ltd. He spent a year and six months as an independent consultant to several companies, including CERN (A
                European nuclear research organization). He developed the program called ‘Enquire’ but never published
                it (W3.org, n.d.).</p>
            <p class="second_bio">From 1981 to 1984, he
                worked at John Poole’s Image computer systems Ltd. In 1984, He came back to CERN for a fellowship
                position. In
                1989,
                while working at CERN in a computing service section, He developed the first proposal that outlined the
                concept behind the web (W3.org, n.d.). He had come up with the idea of enabling researchers worldwide to
                cross documents from one paper to another which links can be added on the same page, when clicked on it,
                popping up with another document. In late 1990, he created the first web server and browser, which ran
                on
                NeXT computers (W3.org, n.d.). This link <br>( http://info.cern.ch) is the first-ever launched website.</p>
            <p class="third_bio"> In 1994, He became a director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the
                Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology. W3C is an
                international organization that develops open web standards. He continues working as a director of W3C
                to
                this day. He founded the World Wide Web Foundation and worked as the director too in 2009. He later
                became a
                professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford in 2016 (W3.org, n.d.). He
                received several honorary degrees and awards from many organizations. The most prestigious award he
                received
                was The ACM A.M. Turing Prize which the association gave for computing machinery for contributions. The
                award is recognized as the Nobel prize for computing (Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 2008).
