            <p>
                Throughout this assessment, I have learned a lot about planning, researching biography, and designing a
                website that involves a problem-solving process. In the beginning, I encountered about lack of ideas to
                start the assessment. Therefore, taking a step back and starting with the simple task such as choosing a
                person I would like to write to first, then moving to other big topics like planning what to write next
                and planning about how to do the website. The whole process of the assessment is not orderly. After I
                finished writing the introductory and biography and I went to design the look of the website. I did HTML
                for the first page and the second page then started to style the website. Subsequently, I went back to
                write reflective writing and edited the CSS file.

            <h2> &lt; What have I learned from computational thinking? &gt;</h2>
            <p>
                Process of how to solve the complex problem by breaking it down into smaller topics. Learn how to solve
                the problem without panicking. Decomposition happened when I had to figure out the steps of working on
                the assessment. Pattern recognition and generalisation happened when I encountered similar problems that
                happened while coding in CSS, such as my original code I separated li tag with four different ids while
                there is not essential to put them in different tags because I intend to add different detail for
                only one tag, therefore to make the code looks easier for reading I make another ul tag with different
                class instead. It also includes things that happened while coding, such as how to separate
                inline, inline-block, block by making the same mistakes using the wrong one, which will help you
                remember what is different between them. There is no guarantee that every task will be finished
                completely in just one attempt considering there will be an iterative process happening; for
                example, an iterative design in the layout of the website; this process happened when I wrote
                when writing contents, I cannot finish the writing before
                everything done thus I will not know that eventually, I will change the layout.

            <h2> &lt; Things that I wish I could do to improve. &gt;</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back, I admit that there are many things that I could do better if I did them in different ways.
                Firstly, I should focus more on planning things by making it more explicit in a paper, such as making a
                schedule, planning the project, or setting a time to finish each part rather than going with a flow.
                This action will push me to become more motivated and finish the assessment sooner. Secondly, taking
                some notes while encountering some problems during working will make it easier than reminiscing when I
                have to transfer things to write in reflection.
